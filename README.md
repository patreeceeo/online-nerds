What is this?
=============

This repo is a living document on how we, the frontend engineers at Metromile AKA the "online nerds", go about doing whatever it is we do. This should all be taken with a grain of salt. If you have a better idea, try it, then make a PR to this repo to let the rest of us know. As we seek the perfection of our craft, lets remember that its not just about how our code effects web browsers but also how it effects the end user, other engineers and human beings in general.
